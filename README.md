**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

Our client is the Gaming Room. They are owners of the Android app, Draw It or Lose It. They have asked us to design a networked multiplayer version of their Draw It or Lose It game. Players will access it via the Internet using any one of multiple client types (i.e. Android, iPhone, browser).

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I think my final recommendations of an operating platform for the game are the highlight of my documentation.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Understanding the client&#39;s requirements and how they impose design constraints on the system is the most essential aspect of the design document and the most helpful aspect thereof in terms of code development.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would readdress the earlier sections of the document in light of the refinement of the design later stated in the document. I would narrow down the constraints and make them less ambiguous.

**How did you interpret the user&#39;s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user&#39;s needs when designing?**

My interpretation of the user&#39;s needs is centered on the user&#39;s abilities and financial wherewithal. The client expressed a lack of expertise in maintaining a distributed network-based application and made it clear that their budget was limited. I chose a cloud-based platform that would free them of the need to hire more experts and free them of the upfront investment of acquiring new hardware. Clearly, if I had proposed an expensive or difficult to manage platform, the client would not go forward with the project. Moreover, it is essential to build something that will satisfy the client as that is the primary purpose of serving them as a consultancy.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Our approach was highly constrained by the UML document provided in the course. The document was well thought out; however, it would be incorrect to take credit for that document and the subsequent implementation of it. I believe my own approach would have been very much the same, but the fact is that the approach was given to us. As for the future, I would carefully gather requirements from the client. I would analyze those requirements to identify the underlying assumptions and to look for both contradictions and ambiguities. Following this analysis, I would review with the client a refined version of the requirements, informed by my findings and negotiate an unambiguous and detailed final version of the requirements. Next, I would design a model (UML) for the proposed implementation, discuss it with others to see if flaws in my model could be identified. Upon improving the model, I would begin implementation while simultaneously adding unit tests to verify the correctness of my code. Along the way, I would review the requirements to ensure that my evolving implementation remained on track.
